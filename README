==================
=  Description:  =
==================

This game plays the classic game of battleship between two computers using
network connection. This game could be played alone against a computer choosing
randomly.


This game created for fun from a final exercise in intro CS course. The original
 game was 4-in-a-row and I wanted to reuse the concept of network game to this
 game.

= How to play: =
================
Set up: this game plays between a server and one client.
run Battleship.py with the flowing arguments:
<player_type> <port> <ip>
player_type - "human" or "random"
port - self explanatory.
ip - server should omit that, and client should input the server ip.

phase 1 - placing ships: each player get 5 ships to put on his board (left) from
 the longest ship to the shortest. To flip from horizontally and vertically
 placing tap space key or right mouse click.
phase 2 - each player in his turn get the chance to attack the other player
board (using the right board). If fail - the other player get his turn.
If succeed - the player get anther shot.

winner - the player who blow up all the opponent ships.
